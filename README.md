### Hi, there 👋

I’m Maciej, a Java Software Engineer specializing in backend microservices within distributed systems. I enjoy building scalable, maintainable applications with clean architecture and modern practices.

💻 Currently, I’m working on backend projects using Spring Boot, Hibernate, and PostgreSQL. I’m also developing my skills in AWS, deploying applications, and improving my understanding of system design and architecture.

🛠️ My toolkit includes Java 21, Spring Framework, Maven, Docker, Git/GitHub, JUnit 5, and more.

🎓 I hold a Bachelor of Engineering in Data Science from Warsaw University of Technology. Some of my repositories focus on data analysis using Python, Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib.
